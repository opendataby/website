You can develop extension for the updatescript processor.
Therefore, I added a bunch of hooks.



hook_updatescripts_process_closed ($script_filepath, $update, $author, $description)

$script_filepath
(string)The filepath of the script.

$update
(boolean)The process was an update.

$author
(string) The name of the script author.

$description
(string) The description of the script.

The hook will be called after processing of each single script.

-----

hook_updatescripts_revert ($script_filepath, $process_times)

$script_filepath
(string)The filepath of the script.

$process_times
(integer)This is the number of times, the script was previously processed.

The hook will be called after reverting of a single script.

-----

updatescripts_config_form ($form, $form_state, $settings)

$form
(array)A form array.

$form_state
(array)A form state array.

$settings
(array)An array of updatescript processor settings.

You can use this function for inject your own config form into the config form of the updatescript processor.
