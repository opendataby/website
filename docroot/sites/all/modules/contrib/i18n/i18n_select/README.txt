CONFIGURATION
-------------

The module allows the user to configure whether or not to filter pages by the
current language. If the Taxonomy translation submodule is also enabled, an
option will be available for how taxonomy term pages are filtered. It also
allows the exclusion of the moduleâ€™s language selection handling for some
elements and certain paths.

2. Navigate to Configuration > Regional and language > Multilingual settings >
   Selection.
3. Select nodes and taxonomy can be filtered by language in the Content to
   Filter by Language field set.
4. The "Content Selection Mode" allows content with specific tags to be skipped
   by entering a list of tags.
5. The "Enable for Specific Pages" field set allows specific pages to be
   included by path.
6. After making choices, Save configuration.
